Hi there!

My name is Bryan McLain.

I am a nerdy guy.  I think Star Trek and Star Wars fans should be friends.  I have a Frodo Baggins Build-a-Bear.  I love my family very much.

I want to learn to make robots fly, and someday hope to make a mark on the world to make this beautiful rock a little bit better for everyone.

Enjoy this GitHub.  Have an excellent day!
